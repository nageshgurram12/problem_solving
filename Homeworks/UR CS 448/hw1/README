-> Viterbi decoding algorithm is implemented in hw1.py and given data is ./data folder

How to Run:

-> To test the code, run ./hw1.py and give the observation sentence and expected tag sentence as inputs
 exmaple: ./hw1.py

[INPUT] 
 Enter input observation sentence: No , it was n't Black Monday
 Enter expected tag sequence: RB , PRP VBD RB NNP NNP

[OUTPUT] 
 Estimated tag sequence: ['UH', ',', 'PRP', 'VBD', 'RB', 'NNP', 'NNP'], 
 Accuracy for the senetence: 85.71
 Overall accuracy on test set: 95.03 %

-> Once it runs for the given sentence & tag sequence, it runs on entire test set and shows accuracy. As per my current implementation, I'm getting 95.03% accuracy on whole test set.
